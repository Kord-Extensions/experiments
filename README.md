# Experiments

This repository contains experimental projects and code that may some day make it into Kord Extensions proper.

The experiments we run here generally require feedback from users before we can finalise them.
If you're interested in these experiments, you should probably

For more information on each experiment, please read the README in the relevant module folder.
